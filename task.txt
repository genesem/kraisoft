Hello Evgenii,

Thank you for expressing interest in our "Web Game Developer" position.
Could you please complete a small test task below?
Create a responsive DIV with a size equal to 80% of viewport. Create a
draggable interactive child element inside, which cannot be dragged
outside the parent DIV.
Results must be uploaded to Github, Gitlab, or another Git service,
preserving the assembly pipeline, webpack.config.js/package.json etc.
